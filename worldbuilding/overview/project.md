# Project: [Untitled Generic Fantasy Setting]

## Structure Rules (For This Doc and All Project Docs)

- Concise. Scannable. No walls of text
- Grammar is sacrificed for clarity when needed
- This doc is a living organism. It gets updated, not appended to
- When something is decided, update the relevant section. Don't add a "v2 update" block
- Sections that grow past ~30 lines should be split into their own doc and linked
- Unanswered questions stay at the bottom until resolved, then get folded into the body

## Thesis

Take the most familiar fantasy setup possible and make every detail earn its place through execution. No clever subversions, no "actually the elves are..." twists. Classic fantasy video game aesthetic, played completely straight, made real through craft and specificity.

The only thing that matters is execution.

## Tone & Aesthetic

Western fantasy. Classic WoW is the touchstone: Elwynn Forest warmth, Duskwood darkness, both in the same world. Towns worth protecting, wilds genuinely dangerous. Dark content is localized and has causes.

Archetypal at the table, detailed underneath. The setting plays it straight. Humor emerges from play.

## Core Engine

**Geography**: Settled coast, wild interior. Civilization thins inland: towns -> villages -> outposts -> nothing. The interior was the center. The coast is the edge that survived.

**History**: The Mage-Lords. Old human empire that ruled from the interior, built with magic, got decadent and weird, destroyed each other. Their ruins are still out there. See [mage-lords.md](mage-lords.md).

**Economy of Adventure**: Money in the ruins, monsters in the wilds. Problems and opportunities generate themselves.

**Power Structure**: Three powers on the coast: Crown, Church, Coin. Each needs something from the ruins, each distrusts the other two. See [factions.md](factions.md).

**The Blank**: What was here before the settlers? Elves in deep forests, subjugated locals, or nothing. Undefined. Don't need it yet.

## What This Means In Practice

- Classic races, classic classes, classic conflicts. No need to rename elves or reinvent orcs
- The craft is in the HOW: what does the blacksmith actually make? What does the trade route carry? What do people eat in the mountain town vs the port city?
- Every NPC has a job. Every town has an economy. Every dungeon was built by someone for a reason
- "Why is there a potion shop here?" should have an answer

## Revealed Preferences (Carry Forward)

From prior work. Non-negotiable:

- No em-dashes in written content
- No LLM-speak: "yet still," "whispered promises," "gods walk distant paths," purple anything
- Concrete > mystical. What people DO, not how the light falls
- Grounded prose. Authority through competence not complexity
- Bullet points when they work better than paragraphs
- Infrastructure and logistics are real worldbuilding, not flavor text
- Delete forced writing, don't try to save it
- Sentence variety. No choppy fragments for false drama
- Precise numbers over vague gestures (the bounty is 50 gold, not "a generous reward")

## Setting Details (Beyond Engine)

**Name**: [TBD]

**System**: 5e 2024

**Races**: Standard fantasy lineup played straight. Humans, elves, dwarves, halflings, gnomes, etc. Orcs are old-school D&D: bad humanoids, raiders, warlike. You don't want them targeting you.

**Magic**: Three streams (arcane, divine, primal) with different histories. Arcane nearly lost, recovering from ruins. See [magic.md](magic.md).

**Tech Level**: Medieval-ish with magic filling gaps. Not industrial

**Religion**: Church of the Light. Not-Catholic, played straight. Saints as divine patrons. See [religion.md](religion.md).

**Deliverable**: Player-facing website planned. Worldbuilding comes first.

## Content Philosophy

This is an exercise. Treat it like practice reps:

- Pick a town. Detail it completely. Economy, people, problems, layout
- Pick a dungeon. Who built it, why, what moved in after, what's the ecology
- Pick a trade route. What moves along it, who protects it, what goes wrong
- Every piece should be usable at a table, not just readable

The goal is not to build an encyclopedia. It's to build small things with total commitment.

## Unanswered Questions

- Name: Not blocking, will matter for the website
