# Crown, Church, Coin

Three powers on the coast. Each needs something from the ruins, each has a reason to distrust the other two. This is the quest generation engine.

## The Contested Resource

The Mage-Lord ruins produce three things worth fighting over: knowledge (spellbooks, formulae), items (intact magical objects), and materials (exotic substances, architectural salvage). Who recovers it, who controls it, and who profits from it is the central tension.

These categories are DM-facing. Players get paid in gold per 5e rules. The distinction matters for why different factions hire adventurers, not for what players track.

## Crown

Weak monarchy. Controls the legal framework, the military (such as it is), and the claim to govern. Needs recovered magic to rebuild infrastructure and project power: roads, fortifications, anything that makes the kingdom more than a name on a map.

**Wants**: Arcane resources to rebuild state capacity. Tax revenue from Coin. Stability.

**Has**: Legitimacy, soldiers, legal authority.

**Problem**: Can't fund its own ambitions. Depends on Coin's taxes but resents the leverage that comes with it. Wants to use what comes out of the ruins freely, but the Church wants oversight.

## Church

The Church of the Light. Mostly good people with institutional self-interest. Had a monopoly on magic for centuries after the collapse. Divine casters were the only game in town, and that bought enormous political loyalty. Every arcane text pulled from a ruin erodes that monopoly.

They don't want to destroy recovered knowledge. They want to control who gets it and how it's used. Their argument is legitimate: last time arcane magic ran unchecked, it destroyed civilization.

**Wants**: Oversight over recovered arcane knowledge. Continued moral and political authority.

**Has**: Temples, healers, organization, centuries of earned trust. See [religion.md](religion.md).

**Problem**: The monopoly is ending whether they like it or not. Competing with Coin for influence in coastal towns. Worried about arcane knowledge leaving the region entirely through Coin's trade network.

## Coin

A shipping company, East India Trading Company in scale and temperament. Deep presence in every coastal town, informal power from money, external soft power through foreign trading partners. Not a government, but in some ports they don't need to be.

**Wants**: To move goods, including recovered materials and items, through their trade network. Access to ruin output without Crown requisition or Church "evaluation." Profit.

**Has**: Ships, money, trade infrastructure, external contacts nobody else has.

**Problem**: Needs Crown stability (safe ports, legal framework) but doesn't want Crown regulation. Needs the coastal towns where the Church has moral authority over the same population Coin has economic authority over.

## The Triangle

Every pair has friction. No pair can afford open war.

- **Crown vs. Church**: Who decides what happens with recovered arcane knowledge. Crown wants to deploy it for state-building. Church wants to vet it for safety. Both have a point.
- **Crown vs. Coin**: Mutual dependency, mutual resentment. Crown needs their tax money. Coin needs their legal framework. Neither wants the other to get strong enough to dictate terms.
- **Church vs. Coin**: Coin exports what the Church wants kept under regional oversight. Both compete for loyalty in the same towns. The Church has moral authority; Coin has payroll.

## What This Means at the Table

A party clears a ruin and comes back with recovered goods. Who do they sell to? That's a faction choice with narrative consequences, not a mechanical system. No reputation tracking. Just "who's your buyer" and what follows from that.

Different factions hire adventurers for different reasons to go to the same places. The dungeon doesn't change. The job does.
