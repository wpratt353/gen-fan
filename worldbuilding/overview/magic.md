# Magic

## The Dark Age

The Mage-Lords hoarded arcane knowledge, built an empire with it, then destroyed each other. The knowledge went with them. Books burned or buried in ruins full of monsters. Entire schools of magic lost in a generation.

The world is in a slow recovery. Some knowledge has been recovered from ruins. That's literally what adventurers are for.

## Three Streams

### Arcane (Wizards, Sorcerers, Bards)

Nearly lost. Recovering slowly from ruin fragments. A wizard needs a spark of intellect AND access to surviving knowledge, which is rare and hard to find. Sorcerers (innate magic) and bards (magic through music) are rarer still. Arcane casters are exceptional by definition.

Current arcane magic is a fraction of what the Mage-Lords could do. Nobody alive knows how to build what they built. The ceiling is visible in every ruin. The path back to it is buried in monster-filled laboratories.

### Divine (Clerics, Paladins)

Never interrupted. Saints and the Light kept answering prayers through the collapse. While arcane magic went dark, divine casters were the only magic users for centuries. This is the foundation of the Church's political power. They had healing, protection, and divine authority when no one else had anything.

### Primal (Druids, Rangers)

Old. Possibly older than the Mage-Lords. Connected to elves, or at least to whatever the elves know. Not taught in institutions, passed through traditions that survived because they had nothing to do with the empire.

The Church tolerates primal magic but doesn't control it. Druids and the Church coexist because neither gains anything from a fight.

## Why the Empire Isn't Rebuilding

Simple: the knowledge is in the ruins and the ruins are dangerous. People ARE trying to recover it. That's the economy of adventure. But it's slow, piecemeal, and deadly. Every spellbook pulled from a Mage-Lord's laboratory is a fragment, not a curriculum.

There is no metaphysical barrier. No damaged weave, no drained ley lines. People just died and took what they knew with them. Dark ages happen for mundane reasons.
