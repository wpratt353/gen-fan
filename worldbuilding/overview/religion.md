## The Church of the Light

Not-Catholic. Played straight. Cathedrals, priestly vestments, hierarchy, doctrine. Every player knows what this looks like. Zero onboarding.

The Church worships [CREATOR GOD], who made the world and stepped back. Saints are mortals the creator elevated as intermediaries. The Church manages humanity's relationship with the divine through the saints. "God made the world and entrusted it to us" is the core theology.

The Church is one of three coastal powers (with Crown and Coin). Its political authority is partly structural (organization, land, money) and partly practical: divine magic kept working through the dark age when arcane magic collapsed. For centuries, Church healers and protectors were the only magic users around. That buys a lot of loyalty.

## Saints

Saints are mortals who became something more. The term is universal. The Church claims the major ones and manages their temples, knightly orders, and feast days. But saints as a concept predate the Church and exist outside it.

A druid's patron is still called a saint by most people, even if the druid uses a different word. That tension is free worldbuilding.

### How Saints Work at the Table

- Clerics and paladins pick a saint. That saint's portfolio maps to their domain/oath
- Druids and rangers connect to primal saints the Church doesn't fully control
- Warlocks: a dead saint who still answers is mechanically identical to a patron
- Players can invent minor saints freely. No lore to contradict

### Major Saints

Established infrastructure: temples, knightly orders, holidays, recognized authority.

**[NAME], the Shieldbearer** (Church)
Portfolio: Protection, duty, sacrifice. Paladin patron. The Church's military arm organizes under this saint's banner. Towns have shrines at their gates.

**[NAME], the Healer** (Church)
Portfolio: Mercy, healing, the sick. Church hospitals bear this saint's name. Clerics of the Healer are the most common divine casters most people ever meet. The Church's soft power.

**[NAME], the Green** (Contested)
Portfolio: Wilderness, growth, the old places. Druids claim this saint predates the Church. The Church says proper canonization occurred. Neither side pushes it too hard. Rural folk don't care about the politics; they pray for good harvests either way.

**[NAME], the Lamplighter** (Church)
Portfolio: Knowledge, travelers, the road. Patron of explorers, scholars, and anyone heading inland. Wayside shrines mark safe roads. Popular with adventurers. The most recently canonized of the four, elevated after the collapse when travel became dangerous and knowledge became scarce.

### Minor Saints

There are minor saints for nearly everything. Patron saint of lost things, of brewers, of first snow, of broken bones. Most have no temple, no clergy, no organization. Just a name people invoke. Players can slot in whatever they want here. If it's minor enough, it exists.
