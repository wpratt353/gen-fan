# The Mage-Lords

Old human empire that ruled from the interior. Built with magic, got decadent and weird, destroyed each other. Their ruins are the primary adventure content.

## The Collapse

Mutual war. Arms race of escalating weird magic, then mutually assured destruction. The interior was the blast zone. The coast survived because it was the edge.

## The Three

Each lord is a **primary trait** (what they did) and a **perpendicular trait** (why they did it). The combination creates dungeon identity.

### Green - Flesh / Scholarship (Female)

Mad scientist. Reshaped living things, catalogued every result. Rooms have readable purpose: labs, holding pens, specimen storage. Notes survive. So do experiments.

**Dungeon feel**: University anatomy department with no ethics board.

### Red - Binding / Paranoia (Male)

Summoned extraplanar entities and bound them as security. Layers of guards watching guards. Every room has a warden. Containment is failing.

**Dungeon feel**: Security system you're breaking into, where the locks are demons.

### Purple - Undeath / Hedonism (Male)

Death didn't change the lifestyle. Ghost musicians, skeletal dancers, wine cellars maintained for centuries. The court is still partying.

**Dungeon feel**: Gatsby's mansion if nobody ever left and nobody ever died. Or rather, everyone died and nobody noticed.
