# The Mage-Lords

Old human empire that ruled from the interior. Built with magic, got decadent and weird, destroyed each other. Their ruins are the primary adventure content.

## The Collapse

Mutual war. Arms race of escalating weird magic, then mutually assured destruction. The interior was the blast zone. The coast survived because it was the edge.

## Realms, Not Dungeons

Each lord ruled a **realm**. Their signature aesthetic (flesh-labs, demon-vaults, ghost courts) exists at their **capital** only. The rest of their territory is normal fantasy infrastructure (villages, farms, mines, towers) complicated by the lord's legacy. The capital is the climax. Most sessions in a lord's realm deal with the fallout.

The lord's identity comes from the **problem**, not the decor. Green's realm has mutation and rogue experiments. Red's has containment failures. Purple's has succession crises and stolen goods.

## The Three

Each lord is a **primary trait** (what they did) and a **perpendicular trait** (why they did it). The combination creates the capital's identity.

### Green - Flesh / Scholarship (Female)

Mad scientist. Reshaped living things, catalogued every result. Rooms have readable purpose: labs, holding pens, specimen storage. Notes survive. So do experiments.

**Capital feel**: University anatomy department with no ethics board.

### Red - Binding / Paranoia (Male)

Summoned extraplanar entities and bound them as security. Layers of guards watching guards. Every room has a warden. Containment is failing.

**Capital feel**: Security system you're breaking into, where the locks are demons.

### Purple - Undeath / Hedonism (Male)

Death didn't change the lifestyle. Ghost musicians, skeletal dancers, wine cellars maintained for centuries. The court is still partying.

**Capital feel**: Gatsby's mansion if nobody ever left and nobody ever died. Or rather, everyone died and nobody noticed.
