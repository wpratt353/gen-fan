# Goldleaf

The starting village. Last civilized stop before the mountain pass to the interior.

## Role

Supply waystation for adventurers heading inland and guards rotating to the defensive post at the pass. The economy runs on adventurer coin and military logistics. Not a destination, a threshold.

## Location

Edge of The Wyld, where the forest meets the foothills before the mountain pass. The pass is ~20-25 miles east (a day's travel as the crow flies, longer by trail). Trail to the pass skirts the forest edge through the foothills - Wyld on one side, mountains rising on the other.

The pass leads to the confluence of all three Mage-Lord territories. The most dangerous and most profitable route into the interior.

## Size & Feel

Village-sized. Maybe 200-400 people plus transient traffic. Cozy but aware of danger. The kind of place where everyone knows who's passing through and veterans drink quietly in corners.

## The Tree

Ancient tree in permanent autumn. Gold and red leaves always falling, never bare. The village built around it because of course they did.

Beneath the canopy, plants grow wrong. Mushrooms, late flowers, things that love the edge of decay but never rot. Animals rest in the roots, unafraid. The season beneath the tree is always harvest-end, regardless of the calendar.

The tree predates the village. Probably predates the Mage-Lords. Druids visit occasionally. The Church says nothing about it.

## The River

Flows from the Wyld, through Goldleaf, downstream toward civilization (possibly to the capital). Dark water, clean but tea-colored from the forest. Locals call it the Teawater or just "the river."

## Faction Presence

All three factions have postings here. Thin presence, not bases of operation. Real faction business happens in the capital.

### Crown

- Guard rotation to/from the defensive post at the pass
- Small garrison commander handles military logistics
- [TBD: Commander NPC, name and personality]

### Church

- Small chapel, one cleric, maybe an acolyte or two
- Healing services for returning adventurers
- Spiritual support for guards heading to the pass
- [TBD: Cleric NPC, which saint they serve]

### Coin

- Supply depot and trading post
- Outfits expeditions heading inland
- First buyer for recovered goods coming back
- [TBD: Coin representative NPC]

## Key Locations

### The Teawater Inn

Built where the river cuts through a rise in the land. Common room sits on stone pilings over the dark water - you hear it underneath, can drop a line through the floor hatch. Building climbs the slope behind. Upper floor gallery faces east toward the pass. On clear nights you can see the fort's firelight.

Good food, warm fires, rooms that feel safe. The social hub. Where adventurers swap rumors and locals size up newcomers.

**Kurgen Wheatwhistle** - Innkeeper. 40s, pot belly, strong arms. Retired adventurer - made it into the interior, lost a close friend, stopped going. Bought the inn. Warm and easy until he isn't. Remembers names, remembers drinks. Knows who's hiring and who didn't come back. Sword and shield hang by the hearth.

### The Chapel

Small but well-maintained. Shrines to [the Shieldbearer] and [the Healer] at minimum. Guards pray before heading to the pass. Returning adventurers give thanks or seek healing.

### The Supply Depot

Coin-operated outfitting shop. Rope, rations, torches, basic gear. Buys recovered goods at fair-ish prices. The representative knows what's been found recently and what expeditions haven't returned.

### The Defensive Post (at the pass)

[TBD: Separate doc? Or detail here?]

The actual military installation. Not in the village but close enough to be the village's reason for existing. Guards rotate through. Crown's forward presence.

## NPCs

[TBD: 3-5 helpful NPCs with jobs, personalities, and reasons to interact with players]

Archetypes to fill:
- Innkeeper (warm, knows everyone)
- Coin rep (practical, knows what's valuable)
- Church cleric (caring, worried about what comes back from the interior)
- Crown commander (duty-focused, understaffed)
- Retired adventurer? Local guide? Blacksmith?

## Local Threats & Hooks

Low-level content. Things that give players reasons to act without going through the pass.

- [TBD: Something in the Wyld that's been causing trouble]
- [TBD: Bandit or orc activity on the road to civilization]
- [TBD: Something personal to an NPC that players can help with]
- Expedition that didn't return (rumor, hook for later)

## Open Questions

- Distance to the capital and other settlements
- Remaining NPCs (Coin rep, Church cleric, Crown commander, others)
