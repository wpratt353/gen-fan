# The Region

[TBD: Name]

The coastal kingdom. The playable area before the interior. One climate, one vibe, variations are subtle.

## Geography

**The gradient:** Coast → Capital → frontier towns → Goldleaf → mountain pass → interior (Mage-Lord ruins)

Civilization thins as you go inland. The coast is settled and safe. The interior is where the old empire was, and where the danger is.

### The Coast

[TBD: Port towns, trade, Coin's stronghold]

Milder weather. Where goods come in and recovered materials go out.

### The Capital

[TBD: Name, size, character]

Where Crown, Church, and Coin have their bases of operation. Real faction business happens here. The destination the starting village points players toward.

### The Frontier

Smaller towns and villages between the capital and the Wyld. Goldleaf is the furthest inland, at the edge.

### The Wyld

The great forest. Old growth primeval. Dark pines, dense understory, cathedral feeling where the canopy closes. The forest gets older and stranger the deeper you go.

Ties to primal magic, possibly elves, possibly something older.

### The Pass

Mountain pass through to the interior. The confluence of all three Mage-Lord territories on the other side. The most dangerous and most profitable route inland. Crown maintains a defensive post here.

## Climate & Aesthetic

Temperate continental. Distinct seasons, cold winters, autumn color. Black Forest Germany is the touchstone.

- Coast: Milder, wetter
- Inland: Colder winters, more snow
- The Wyld: Darker, damper, the canopy traps weather

## Flora & Fauna

[TBD: Specific plants, animals, what's edible, what's dangerous]

Generally: Dense conifer and deciduous forest. Deer, boar, wolves, bears. Normal animals, some larger or meaner in the Wyld.

## Threats

Low-level, classic fantasy:

- Bandits on the roads
- Wolves, especially in winter
- Orcs somewhere deep (a clan that's hard to root out)
- Goblins in places
- Things that wander out of the Wyld
- Things that wander down from the pass

The region is not safe, but it's manageable. The interior is where the real danger is.

## Peoples

[TBD: Where do elves live? Dwarves and gnomes? Any non-human settlements in the region?]

Mostly human. Other peoples exist but details TBD.
