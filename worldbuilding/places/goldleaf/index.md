# Goldleaf

The starting village. Last civilized stop before the mountain pass to the interior.

## Role

Supply waystation for adventurers heading inland and guards rotating to the defensive post at the pass. The economy runs on adventurer coin and military logistics. Not a destination, a threshold.

## Location

Edge of The Wyld, where the forest meets the foothills before the mountain pass. The pass is ~20-25 miles east (a day's travel as the crow flies, longer by trail). Trail to the pass skirts the forest edge through the foothills - Wyld on one side, mountains rising on the other.

The pass leads to the confluence of all three Mage-Lord territories. The most dangerous and most profitable route into the interior.

## Size & Feel

Village-sized. Maybe 200-400 people plus transient traffic. Cozy but aware of danger. The kind of place where everyone knows who's passing through and veterans drink quietly in corners.

## The Tree

Ancient tree in permanent autumn. Gold and red leaves always falling, never bare. The village built around it because of course they did.

Beneath the canopy, plants grow wrong. Mushrooms, late flowers, things that love the edge of decay but never rot. Animals rest in the roots, unafraid. The season beneath the tree is always harvest-end, regardless of the calendar.

The tree predates the village. Probably predates the Mage-Lords. Druids visit occasionally. The Church says nothing about it.

## The River

Flows from the Wyld, through Goldleaf, downstream toward civilization (possibly to the capital). Dark water, clean but tea-colored from the forest. Locals call it the Teawater or just "the river."

## Faction Presence

All three factions have postings here. Thin presence, not bases of operation. Real faction business happens in the capital.

### Crown

- 12-16 soldiers rotating on 8-week cycles to/from the pass fort
- Garrison commander handles military logistics on a budget that covers maybe 60% of what she needs
- Reports to Captain Hallis Thorne, regional command in Crosshill (80 miles west)
- Commander: **Annet Varrow**

### Church

- Small chapel, one cleric, no acolyte (requested three times, denied each time)
- Healing services for returning adventurers
- Intelligence gathering: what's coming back from the interior, whether arcane residue is present
- Monthly written reports to Bishop Corren Vails in Millhaven (60 miles SW)
- Cleric: **Sister Marda Lenn** (serves the Healer)

### Coin

- Supply depot and trading post on the main road
- Outfits expeditions heading inland, first buyer for recovered goods coming back
- Goods logged as "architectural salvage" and shipped downstream by river barge to the regional hub in Ashford (40 miles downstream) before the Church can assert evaluation rights
- Reports to Factor Marin Drovis, Ashford regional hub
- Representative: **Oskar Levit**

## Key Locations

### The Teawater Inn

Built where the river cuts through a rise in the land. Common room sits on stone pilings over the dark water - you hear it underneath, can drop a line through the floor hatch. Building climbs the slope behind. Upper floor gallery faces east toward the pass. On clear nights you can see the fort's firelight.

Good food, warm fires, rooms that feel safe. The social hub. Where adventurers swap rumors and locals size up newcomers. Run by **Kurgen Wheatwhistle**.

### The Chapel

Small but well-maintained. Two-room structure: main hall with shrines to the Shieldbearer and the Healer, back room is quarters, storage, and workspace. Guards pray before heading to the pass. Returning adventurers give thanks or seek healing. Lightsday morning services (20-30 villagers), Shieldday evening services (8-12 guards, more debrief than devotion).

### The Supply Depot

Coin-operated outfitting shop on the main road. Rope, rations, torches, basic gear. Buys recovered goods at 40% of assessed value, no questions. Won't touch obviously magical items -- too much scrutiny. But he'll buy the scabbard. River barges dock at the depot twice monthly for downstream shipment.

### The Defensive Post (at the pass)

The actual military installation. Not in the village but close enough to be the village's reason for existing. Guards rotate through. Crown's forward presence.

## NPCs

**Kurgen Wheatwhistle** - Innkeeper. 40s, pot belly, strong arms. Retired adventurer -- made it into the interior, lost a close friend, stopped going. Bought the inn. Warm and easy until he isn't. Remembers names, remembers drinks. Knows who's hiring and who didn't come back. Sword and shield hang by the hearth.

**Commander Annet Varrow** - Crown garrison commander. 55, female. Career soldier, curt, no filler. "Name's Varrow. You're armed. You staying or passing through?" Runs the garrison on a favor economy: soldiers repair village structures for meals at cost, chop firewood for the chapel in exchange for boot repair. Keeps three ledgers -- two official, one personal favor log that's how the garrison actually runs. Predecessor embezzled and vanished; she inherited the mess and made it clean. Respects competence. Has written 83 letters to families of people who died at the pass. Counts on her fingers when doing mental arithmetic.

**Sister Marda Lenn** - Church cleric of the Healer. 54, female. Warm but direct. Heals you, asks what you found while she's bandaging your leg, reports it upstream. Everyone knows the deal. No hidden conflict. Genuinely believes unchecked arcane magic is dangerous -- the Mage-Lords fell because nobody was watching. Listens with complete attention; makes people say more than they planned. Kurgen calls her "the only honest spy I've ever met." Offers peppermints to everyone. Overworked. Shows in her face.

**Oskar Levit** - Coin supply depot operator. 58, male. 34 years with the Coin Company. Minimal, functional. "Rope's 1 silver per 50 feet. How much do you need?" Posted prices, non-negotiable, fair. Doesn't volunteer information. Logs everything as "architectural salvage" or "decorative metalwork" -- uses the phrase "for record-keeping purposes" without irony. Won't buy obviously magical items, but he'll buy the scabbard. True believer: thinks Coin is the faction actually rebuilding civilization. Wife died 6 years ago. Wants 3 more years, then retire near his daughter in Ashford.

## Local Threats & Hooks

Low-level content. Things that give players reasons to act without going through the pass. Each is a situation, not a plot. Independent of each other, any order, any combination.

- [Fox Territory](hooks/fox-territory.md) - Wyld-touched predator claiming ground near the village edge
- [The Mud Mile](hooks/mud-mile.md) - Deserters running a toll on a sabotaged stretch of road
- [Kurgen's Cellar](hooks/kurgens-cellar.md) - Rot in the inn cellar, guilt in the innkeeper
- Expedition that didn't return (rumor, hook for later)

## Open Questions

- Distance to the capital and other settlements
- The defensive post at the pass (separate doc or detail here)
