# Kurgen's Cellar

## The Situation

Rot is growing on stored adventurer gear in the Teawater Inn's cellar, where the Goldleaf Tree's roots run beneath the foundation. Pale shelf mushrooms on leather packs, mildewed cloaks, a shortbow with fungus on the grip. Kurgen has compensated three parties this month for ruined gear. He's losing money and reputation.

The actual problem: there's a wound in the tree's root system under the cellar, seeping sap that feeds the fungus. Kurgen's dead friend -- the one he lost in the interior, the reason he quit adventuring -- carved their initials into that root twenty years ago, before either of them knew it connected to the Goldleaf Tree. Kurgen found the carving when he bought the inn. He thinks he cursed the tree. He thinks this is his fault.

It isn't. The root wound is just damaged bark letting moisture and forest fungi in. A mundane problem with an emotional wrapper.

## Entry Points

- Players' own gear starts rotting in the cellar overnight (personal stakes)
- Kurgen asks for help directly (vulnerable moment; he's normally guarded about this)
- Sister Marda mentions Kurgen asked her about "cleansing old wounds" and she's worried about him
- Players notice the cellar smells wrong when Kurgen fetches a keg

## Resolution Paths

- Treat the root wound (mundane: tar/resin seal; or minor druidic/divine healing)
- Discover the rot is ordinary fungi on damaged bark, not a curse (reframes Kurgen's guilt)
- Convince Kurgen the carving is a memorial, not a curse (pure RP resolution)
- Sister Marda performs a small rite of release (she's been wanting to do more fieldwork)
- Purify the cellar with magic and seal the crack in the foundation
- Do nothing about Kurgen's feelings, just fix the practical problem

## If Ignored

Kurgen closes the cellar storage. Inn loses a revenue stream. He becomes more withdrawn, guilt compounding. After a few months, rot reaches the taproom floor (structural issue). He considers selling the inn. The village loses its social hub.

## DM Notes

Cellar layout: rough rectangle, kegs along one wall, gear storage along the other. The root comes through the east wall where the foundation meets bedrock. The carving: two sets of initials, a date. Pick a name for the dead friend -- something simple. The actual cause is damaged bark + moisture. No magic needed to diagnose, but magic can fix it faster.

The sword and shield hanging by the hearth upstairs belonged to the friend, not Kurgen.
