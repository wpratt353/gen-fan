# The Mud Mile

## The Situation

A one-mile stretch of road downslope from Goldleaf turns to mud soup every rain. Wagons get stuck for hours. In the last two weeks, four merchant parties have been "helped" by locals who charge 5gp per wagon to winch them through. The helpers are six people camped in the woods: four ex-soldiers (deserters from the pass fort), one teenager, one older woman who cooks. They have proper equipment. They're not hiding. Varrow knows they're there.

They're sabotaging the road -- loosening drainage, diverting a creek. Desperate, not violent. If they make 30-40gp total, they plan to move on to a city and disappear. Varrow can't spare soldiers to arrest them or fix the road. Coin cares but won't pay for repairs (not their road).

## Entry Points

- Merchants at the Teawater Inn complaining loudly about the "mud tax"
- Oskar Levit asks party to deliver a small crate to the pass fort; route goes through the mud
- Players get stuck themselves on arrival or departure
- Varrow offers 5gp to "make the problem go away" (deliberately vague)

## Resolution Paths

- Pay them the 30gp to leave (easiest, fastest)
- Fix the drainage yourself (labor + basic engineering)
- Arrest them for Varrow (combat likely)
- Negotiate: they fix the road, village feeds them while they work off a debt
- Hire them for different work (Kurgen needs cellar maintenance, Varrow always needs labor)
- Varrow offers clemency if they fix the road + serve 2 weeks garrison duty

## If Ignored

They make their money in two more weeks and vanish. Road stays broken until Crown engineers arrive in spring (if the budget allows). Merchants start avoiding Goldleaf, economy dips. Not catastrophic, but the village feels it.

## DM Notes

Six NPCs: only 4 fight (level 1 fighters, clubs, no armor). 25gp on them total. Give names to 2-3 of them. Why they deserted: underpaid, bad rotation, no one will miss them. Varrow's frustration is real -- she's written their names in her personal ledger already.
