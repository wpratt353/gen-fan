# Fox Territory

## The Situation

A Wyld-touched fox has claimed territory starting about two miles into the forest. Twice normal size, silver-white, hunts by standing absolutely still until prey approaches. Other foxes have either joined its pack or fled. The boundary is exact: no fox tracks past the split oak. Trappers are losing income. Other predators are acting confused -- wolves circling during day, owls silent.

## Entry Points

- Trapper offers 2gp per fox pelt, will pay double for scouting information
- Commander Varrow wants to know if this is Wyld expansion (garrison concern)
- A farmer's dog came back limping from the treeline, won't go near the Wyld anymore
- Hunters mention the silence at the Teawater Inn

## Resolution Paths

- Hunt the alpha fox (combat challenge for level 1-2)
- Mark territory boundaries humans actually use (negotiation with nature)
- Establish watch points to track movement
- Wait it out; the pack may migrate seasonally
- Consult the druids who visit the Goldleaf Tree occasionally

## If Ignored

Boundary moves closer, roughly 1 mile per month. Trappers abandon outer cabins. Winter concentrates predators toward the village for easier prey. Not existential, but the economy tightens and people get nervous.

## DM Notes

Fox is CR 1/2. Pack of 4 normal foxes (CR 0). Alpha pelt worth 20gp to the right buyer. Won't pursue fleeing targets past the split oak. Boundary location and movement rate are the key things to track.
